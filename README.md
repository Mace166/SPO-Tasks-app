# SPO-Tasks-app
A User Interface (UI) design using Adobe XD for a Fabric UI/React Tasks app based on SharePoint Online.

### Concept
To design a Sharepoint Online Tasks SPFX application.

### Requirements
The app design will be created using Adobe XD and the Fabric UI toolkit.

The app must be intuitive and easy to use without training.

As the app would be inserted into a SharePoint Online Modern Experience site page zone, it must support a 100%, 50%, 33% and 67% column width.

The design must include the end-user functionality and how to edit the app from the side property pane.

The app should show the SharePoint online site theme colors fit into the existing styling of the page.

While the app itself will not be built as part of this project, the design must support an app created with React.

### Design Notes
The Tasks list is a default list on SPO.

The tasks can be categorised and I would like to incorporate this into the design.

There may be a single category, several or many tasks categories, so the app needs to provide easy access to the tasks and still allow for focusing on to a single category when needed.

When designing a UI, I like to give control to the end-user over how they use the app. Therefore, I would like the end-user to be able to choose if they would like a simplified UI or a more detailed "power user" UI to suit their capabilities or preferences. This option would then be stored as a setting within the app and be persistent.

The end result would include an example of the design with a selection of different coloured themes.

The design will incorporate Sharepoint Online into its end-user functionality to demonstrate how it would look on a Modern Experience Team Site. This includes how it would function inside columns of different widths.

### Design Evolution
The design is intended to evolve and be refined over time. If there are significant deviations in the design, I will create a new branch and provide the updated version while preserving the previous.
