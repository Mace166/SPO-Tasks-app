### Prototype
This initial version has been built for a Modern Experience Team Site, but should work equally well for a Communication Site.
This is an app that would need at least 2/3 columns of the page if not a complete single column row.
The mobile styling and editing via the property pane screens may be incorporated in a later version.

**Next changes:**
1. Feedback on the design and revisions.
1. Create a mobile phone version of this app as a responsive design.
